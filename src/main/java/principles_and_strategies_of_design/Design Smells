Design Smells - indication in the design that you are doing something wrong

Design Smells - negatively effect quality of development
1) Rigidity - tight coupling. When 1 change in code affects 10 lines as a result.
2) Fragility - Software breaks after 1 change.
3) Immobility - Too much risk of separating (refactoring the code) because everything breaks.
4) Viscosity - When design change is more difficult to use than a hack.
5) Needless repetition - copy paste
6) Needless complexity - extra complex

If several classes duplicate each other - Use inheritance
If there is too many public classes - Use encapsulation
If the classes are too large - Split

Code smells:
hard to read
breaks easily
hard to maintain (adding new features, fix bugs)

Summary:
- follow good design principles
- always strive for cohesion and loose coupling
- don`t over-engineering
