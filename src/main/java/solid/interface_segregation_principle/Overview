Client SHOULD NOT be FORCED to depend upon interfaces (or interface methods) that they do not use!

Split Interfaces into several small interfaces

Interfaces are tricky, because once we have created the method this is IT!
Very hard to refactor, because all clients need to implement it.
OOP Designer Nightmare: "Fat" Interface.

BUT! It also doesn`t mean that Interfaces should have only 1 method!
We need to be smart here. We need to understand what client wants.
