Builder - use when we struggle with the construction of a complex object. Pass parameters, lots of variables, etc...
Builder uses multi-step process to create object.

Example of a complex object creation:
- building a vacation planner for Disney World:
* choose hotel,
* various types of admission tickets,
* make restaurant reservations,
* book special event

Examples:
java.lang.StringBuilder

Use Builder pattern when:
1) object creation should be independent,
2) construction process allows different representations,
3) object can be immutable - can be changed after creation (String vs StringBuilder)
