Cricket game

suppose you are a member of a cricket team
the captain of each side must go for a toss to decide which side will (bat or bowl) first
if team doesn't have a captain -> you need to create him, BUT team cannot have more than one captain

use Singleton to ensure that team has ONLY one captain
prerequisite - use bill_pugh approach
Singleton class name - Captain

Console output:

Trying to make a captain for our team
New Captain selected for our team
Trying to make another captain for our team
You already have a captain for your team. Send him for the toss.
c1 and c2 are same instances
