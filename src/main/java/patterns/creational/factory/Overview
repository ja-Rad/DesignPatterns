Factory - one of the most used Java patterns

Defines an interface for creating an object (Creator)
It lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate

Example

I have 2 TVs: LED and LCD
One TV is broken, I call repairman. He asks which one is broken?
As per my input, he will take required instruments either for LED or LCD tv

I just repairman (Factory) which TV should be fixed. He then goes and fixes it.
