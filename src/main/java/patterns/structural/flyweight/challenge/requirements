Counter-Strike game

We will reuse players:
- Terrorist (T)
- Counter Terrorist (CT)

whenever player needs a weapon we give it to them.
If we don't use Flyweight here then we would need one object for each player (For example, 5T + 5CT = 10 objects)
But WE USE Flyweight, so 5T + 5CT = 2 objects here
REMEMBER! INTRINSIC AND EXTRINSIC STATES!
INTRINSIC: task

EXTRINSIC: weapon
