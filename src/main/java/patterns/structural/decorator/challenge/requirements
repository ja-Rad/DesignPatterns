Use Decorator pattern to draw Shapes

1) component - Shape interface: draw() <- no real logic just some sout
2) concrete components - Rectangle, Circle
3) decorator - ShapeDecorator abstract class that Extends Component. HAS A Component + setter.
4) concrete decorators - RedShapeDecorator, GreenShapeDecorator: sout the additional functionality

Example output:

Circle with normal border
Shape: Circle

Circle of red border
Shape:Circle
Border Color: Red

Rectangle of red border
Shape:Rectangle
Border color: Red
