Adapter - converts interface of a class into another.
Adapter is used to make two unrelated classes work together.
If we have 2 incompatible classes then we use Adapter to make conversion, to talk between classes.
Also known as a Wrapper.

There is 2 ways for adapter design:
Composition - preferred (used for most cases)
Inheritance (problem: requires support of multiple inheritance that Java doesn`t have)

Example,
We want to use EU made laptop in the UK. This laptop expects Standard EU Plug, but we have only UK outlet.
The Solution is to use UK Adapter:

EU LAPTOP -> EU PLUG -> UK ADAPTER -> UK OUTLET

Collection classes use an Iterator and this example uses adapter,
so that without knowing how collection class works we can still iterate

Java Example:
- java.util.Arrays#asList()
- java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream) (returns a Reader)
- java.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream) (returns a Writer)
